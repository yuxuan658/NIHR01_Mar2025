<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Brief project overview</h3>

This proposal focuses on addressing analytical challenges in complex spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, particularly in the context of malignant human diseases like gliomas and melanoma brain metastasis. Recent advancements in single-cell genome sequencing allow for detailed gene expression profiling at the individual cell level, offering insights that conventional bulk analyses miss. The proposal aims to develop innovative analytical methods to enhance understanding of cellular heterogeneity and identify significant biomarkers associated with various brain tumors.
